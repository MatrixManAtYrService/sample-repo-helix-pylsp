This repo exists to facilitate communication about project structure.  Unless you're chasing this bug, it probably doesn't do anything useful for you.

### happy path

When I am editing files in `src`, imports autocomplete without trouble

```
hx  src/sample/say_foo.py
# 'import samp...' autocompletes
```

### sad path

But when I edit files in `test`, imports do not autocomplete
  
```
hx test/test_say_foo.py
# 'import samp...' does not autocomplete
```

### my config

I'm using helix.
The relevant config file is [languages.toml](./languages.toml).
It was generated by home-mangager, the relevant module is [python.nix](./python.nix).

I have configured it to run `pyslp -v --log-file /Users/matt/pylsp.log`.
The happy path and sad path appear to produce more or less the same logs:
- [happy](./pylsp.works.log)
- [sad](./pylsp.breaks.log)
 
What must I do so that my project modules autocomplete when referenced from my test modules?
